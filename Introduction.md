# Markdown & GitHub

A lecture for CSCI 5828: Foundations of Software Engineering

Lecture 3 &mdash; 09/01/2015

## Lecture Goals

* Present a brief introduction to Markdown and GitHub
* Present examples of the types of presentations I want you to create

## Purpose: Getting Ready for the Presentations

I'm asking that all presentations this semester be uploaded to GitHub. That means you need to be comfortable with the
following technologies.

* [git](http://www.git-scm.com)
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [GitHub](https://help.github.com/)

Last Thursday and today, I presented an [introduction to `git`](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5828/f15/lectures/02-git.pdf).
Now, let's continue and learn about Markdown and GitHub. I will then bring it all together and show
you some example presentations. (You're looking at one now.)
