# Markdown & GitHub

This is an example repository in support of Ken Anderson's [Fall 2015 CSCI 5828 class](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5828/f15/). This repository mimics the contents of the Markdown & Github lecture that he gave on September 1, 2015. It recreates the content of that lecture as a series of Markdown files. You can see the table of contents below.
