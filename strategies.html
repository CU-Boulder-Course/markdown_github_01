          <h1>Strategies for Using GitHub Presentations</h1>

          <h2>Overview</h2>

          <p>There are three basic approaches for creating your presentations in GitHub.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Create a repo that contains both code and Markdown files. The Markdown files act as your presentation.</li>
            <li>Create a repo that uses the <code>gh-pages</code> branch to create a website that GitHub serves</li>
            <li>Create a repo with both code and Markdown files in the <code>master</code> branch and a website in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Option 1: Markdown/Code in <code>master</code> branch</h2>

          <p>If you pick a topic that requires writing a lot of code, then you can use <code>git</code> to create a repo with a <code>master</code> branch. Your repo would have a top-level directory that contained a <code>README.md</code> file, a <code>src</code> directory and a <code>docs</code> directory to contain a Markdown-based presentation. You might have other top level directories that contain data, resources, and other information (such as installation instructions).</p>

          <p>Say you decided to do a presentation on <em>Functional Programming in Scala</em> and how Scala and the functional programming paradigm can help software engineers write better code. You can create sub-directories under the <code>src</code> directory for each of your Scala-based examples. You can create a set of Markdown files in the <code>docs</code> directory that presents your information on Scala and functional program and uses Markdown code-blocks to present your Scala code examples. Your <code>README.md</code> might then contain pointers and instructions on how to install Scala and how to run the various code examples.</p>

          <p>You would have your repo on your local machine and on GitHub. You might work on the code on your machine and do frequent commits and uploads to GitHub (via <code>git push</code>). You might then switch to working on the Markdown using GitHub's markdown editor, making frequent commits on-line. You would then update your local repo with <code>git pull</code> to keep it consistent.</p>

          <h2>Option 2: Website in <code>gh-pages</code> branch</h2>

          <p>If your presentation has no code but lots of text and images, then you can create a repo that takes advantage of GitHub's ability to associate a website with a given repo.</p>

          <p>To take advantage of this functionality, follow these (high-level) steps:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>create a new repo and associate it with GitHub</li>
            <li><code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</code> (you will never use the <code>master</code> branch again)</li>
            <li>add HTML, CSS, and Javascript to your repo</li>
            <li><code>git push -u origin gh-pages</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>If your repo is stored at</p>

          <p><code>https://github.com/&lt;USER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;</code></p>

          <p>then your website will automatically appear at</p>

          <p><code>https://&lt;USER&gt;.github.io/&lt;REPO&gt;/</code></p>

          <p>I did this last year for one of my seminars:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Repo: &lt;<a href="https://github.com/cu-data-engineering-s15/lecture_05">https://github.com/cu-data-engineering-s15/lecture_05</a>&gt;</li>
            <li>Website: &lt;<a href="https://cu-data-engineering-s15.github.io/lecture_05/">https://cu-data-engineering-s15.github.io/lecture_05/</a>&gt;</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Option 3: Why not Both?</h2>

          <p>If you have a topic that requires both text AND code, then you can combine both strategies. You store code, data, resources, and instructions in the <code>master</code> branch of the repo and you store HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the repo on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

          <p>To take advantage of this approach, follow these (high-level) steps</p>

          <ol>
            <li>create a new repo and associate it with GitHub</li>
            <li>on the <code>master</code> branch, fill it with code and markdown files</li>
            <li><code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</code></li>
            <li><code>git rm -rf .</code>; <code>git commit</code></li>
            <li>Now, fill the <code>gh-pages</code> branch with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
            <li>Switch between the two branches to work on code (<code>master</code>) and your website (<code>gh-pages</code>) until done</li>
            <li><code>git push</code> frequently to view repo/website as it evolves on GitHub</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Note: step 4 creates an empty working directory on the gh-pages branch. It will consist of multiple calls to the <code>git rm</code> command until everything in the working directory has been deleted, followed by a <code>git commit</code> to give the <code>gh-pages</code> branch a new starting point.</p>

          <p>This might seem scary, but it's not. All of those files are safe on the <code>master</code> branch. Just enter <code>git checkout master</code> to see them again and then <code>git checkout gh-pages</code> to go back to the empty directory so you can start working on your website.</p>

          <h2>Examples</h2>

          <p>I have created two examples to view associated with my Github account.</p>

          <p>The first is this lecture presented with Markdown files on the master branch of this repository.</p>

          <p>Option 1: <a href="https://github.com/kenbod/markdown_github_01">https://github.com/kenbod/markdown_github_01</a></p>

          <p>The second is this lecture presented, again, as a website on the gh-pages branch of the same repository. (You're looking at it now!)</p>

          <p>Option 2: <a href="https://kenbod.github.io/markdown_github_01">https://kenbod.github.io/markdown_github_01</a></p>

          <p>A <q>code heavy</q> example is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
