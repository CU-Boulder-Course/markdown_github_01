# Markdown

Markdown is a mark-up language created by John Gruber in 2004. The spec has been available from his website,
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), ever since:

* Markdown Specification: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

He describes Markdown like this:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write
> using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally
> valid XHTML (or HTML).

> Thus, <q>Markdown</q> is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and &hellip;

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as
> possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as
> plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
> While Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the
> single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

## Markdown is Everywhere

Markdown proved to be very popular. Support for it has popped up in all sorts of places.
There are [dedicated](http://www.markdownpad.com) [markdown](https://stackedit.io) [editors](https://ia.net/writer/mac/)
and [GitHub uses it extensively](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/).
Finally, there are many blogging systems that will accept markdown-formatted articles and convert them to
HTML automatically.

Indeed, **all** of the Daring Fireball website is written in Markdown.

For instance, go to this URL: <http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/08/28/panzerino-twotter>

Then, change it to this URL: <http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/08/28/panzerino-twotter.text>

Markdown is thus a project that <q>scratched an itch</q> for John Gruber. It is an example
of [eating your own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food): using your **own** software everyday.

## HTML Allowed

Markdown’s reason for existence is to take text and convert it to HTML. As a result, if there is something that
HTML allows but Markdown doesn't support, just insert the HTML directly into the Markdown source. This applies to
block level elements as well as in-line elements of HTML. See <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>
for details. For instance, the official version of Markdown does not support tables. So, in the official version of
Markdown, if you need a table just add it using HTML's **table**, **thead**, **tbody**, **tr**, and **td** tags
as needed to create the table. (Note: GitHub's version (or <q>flavor</q>) of Markdown does support tables.)

### Example

```
This is a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> paragraph

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This is a second Markdown paragraph
```

### Result

This is a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> paragraph

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This is a second Markdown paragraph

## Why?

Why did I present this information?

Because GitHub uses Markdown everywhere and even adds new features to Markdown. What
does [GitHub add to Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)?

* URL auto-linking
* ~~Free ponies!~~ Strikethrough text
* Fenced code blocks and syntax highlighting
* Tables

## Trying out the Examples

Note: You can try out any of the examples shown in this lecture.

Head to: <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus> and then cut-and-paste the example text
into the <q>dingus</q> and click on the `convert` button.

You can also use GitHub as a Markdown editor. Just:

* Create a new repo and indicate that it should have a README.md file created automatically.
* Edit the README.md file and put any Markdown text that you want.
* Flip to the <q>Preview</q> tab at any point to see the Markdown rendered as HTML.
